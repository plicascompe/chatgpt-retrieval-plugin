## What are Signals and Systems?
 
Signals and systems are two fundamental concepts in engineering and science that deal with the representation, analysis, and processing of information. A signal is a function that conveys some information about the behavior or attributes of a physical phenomenon or system. A system is a device or algorithm that performs some operation on a signal to produce another signal.
 
Signals and systems can be classified into different types based on their properties and characteristics. For example, signals can be continuous-time or discrete-time, periodic or aperiodic, deterministic or random, analog or digital, and so on. Systems can be linear or nonlinear, time-invariant or time-varying, causal or non-causal, stable or unstable, and so on.
 
Signals and systems are ubiquitous in various fields of engineering and science, such as communications, control, biomedical, image processing, audio processing, radar, sonar, robotics, and many more. They are used to model, analyze, design, and implement systems that perform various tasks such as data transmission, data compression, data encryption, data filtering, data detection, data modulation, data demodulation, data enhancement, data restoration, data recognition, data classification, data synthesis, and so on.
