Jenny's handler, Susan Smith, said she was thrilled and proud of her canine companion. "She's such a sweet and smart girl. She loves to please and she loves to work. She's been showing since she was a puppy and she always gives her best," Smith said.
 
Jenny is the first Labrador retriever to win Best in Show at Westminster, the oldest and most prestigious dog show in the United States. She is also the oldest dog to win the award, breaking the record set by a 10-year-old Sussex spaniel in 2009.
 
Jenny's owner, John Jones, said he was overjoyed by Jenny's victory. "She's more than just a dog to us. She's part of our family. She's been with us since she was born and she's brought us so much happiness and joy. We're so grateful to have her in our lives," Jones said.
 
Jenny will now enjoy a year of fame and glory as the reigning Best in Show champion. She will also receive a trophy, a rosette, and a cash prize of $50,000. Smith said she plans to retire Jenny from showing after this year and let her enjoy her golden years as a pet.
  
Jenny's win was also a historic moment for the Labrador retriever breed, which is the most popular dog breed in the United States according to the American Kennel Club. Despite their popularity and versatility, Labradors have never won Best in Show at Westminster until now.
 
Dr. Mary Brown, a veterinarian and a Labrador breeder, said she was delighted by Jenny's achievement. "It's a long overdue recognition for this wonderful breed. Labradors are loyal, friendly, intelligent, and hardworking. They can excel in many fields, from hunting and retrieving to service and therapy. They are also great family dogs that get along with everyone," Brown said.
 
Brown said she hopes Jenny's win will inspire more people to appreciate and adopt Labradors, especially those in need of rescue or adoption. "There are so many Labradors out there who are looking for loving homes. They deserve a chance to be happy and to make someone else happy. If you're thinking of getting a dog, please consider a Labrador. You won't regret it," Brown said.
  
The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is the second-longest continuously held sporting event in the United States, after the Kentucky Derby. It was founded in 1877 and has been held every year since then, except for 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The show attracts thousands of dogs and spectators from around the world, as well as millions of viewers on television and online.
 
The show consists of two days of judging, where dogs are evaluated based on their appearance, movement, and temperament according to their breed standards. The dogs are divided into seven groups: sporting, hound, working, terrier, toy, non-sporting, and herding. The winners of each group compete for the Best in Show award on the final night.
 
The show also features other events, such as agility, obedience, and junior showmanship competitions. The show aims to celebrate the diversity and beauty of dogs, as well as their bond with humans. The show's motto is "Every dog has its day."
